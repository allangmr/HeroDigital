# Indication for Use

This project requires the installation of npm install packages. 
In addition to that, if you do not have the node JSON SERVER package you must install it in order to use the Mock Api.

## Instalation JSON-SERVER
The installation of json-server can be done from the command:
npm install -g json-server

## Server start-up

It is important that you first launch the command json-server --watch src/db.json before the npm start command, 
otherwise you will have problems, since I configured the json-server to start on port 3000.

## Run json-server command

json-server --watch src/db.json

## Next step to follow

npm start


## Everything is ready

Ready, you should be running the project with the mock api correctly. I hope you like it.
